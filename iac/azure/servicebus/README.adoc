== Create your infrastructure

Through this module you'll be to create the needed bits for interacting with Azure Servicebus

=== Terraform steps

First of all init terraform

[source,sh]
----
$ terraform init
----

Then run the command to apply your configuration to your Azure account

[source,sh]
----
$ terraform apply -var="services_bus_namespace_name=<namespace_name>" -var="resource_group_name=<resource_name>" -var="location=<location>" -var="messages_queue_name=<queue_name>" -out tfout.log
----

Correctly populating the various field for your needs

Once the process will complete you'll get a sensitive output for the primary connection String

You're now able to read the sensitive data with

[source,sh]
----
terraform output --raw messages_queue_name
----

This string should be used in the application.properties of the servicebus kamelets example
